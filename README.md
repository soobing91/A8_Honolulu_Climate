# Honolulu Climate App

A database that contains precipitation and temperature data and weather station data of Honolulu, Hawaii, is retrieved for the following analyses:
* Precipitation analysis featuring the last 12 months of data,
* Temperature analysis with the last 12 months of data per each station,
* Average temperature for the desired range of dates, and
* Daily rainfall average per each weather station.

For details, refer to `climate_SooBin.ipynb`.

A Python Flask app that enables the analysis is created and written in `app_sooBin.py`.
